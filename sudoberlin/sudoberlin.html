    <h2>About</h2>
    <p>Hello! My name is Shubham. I am a Graduate student at The University of Texas at Dallas, United States, on track to earn my Master's degree in computer science. 
    </p>
    <p>I care about the democratization of technology and believe that our best shot is to supersede and augment human capability. Hence, AI interests me genuinely. I like to explore Artificial Intelligence and its implications on modern software and its design. These fascinating applications, like Google Translate, which makes sequence-to-sequence translation possible using various AI technologies, put together in systems designed exceptionally well, are what I endeavour to create every day. I (have also worked with) (would like to explore) distributed systems owing to their utility in working together to solve real-world problems, much like humans do. </p>
    <p>I like to solve things and respect the sanctity of challenges, all of which foster learning. Based on my experiences in AI/ML and systems design, I would love to work with teams and projects that inquire into these fields and their applications. 
        Thank You!
    </p>
